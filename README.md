👋 Hi, I’m Atul Kumar Chandel, currently working as a Product Engineer at Temenos, where I focus on software development, software quality assurance and automation testing.
👀 I have a broad interest in developing test automation tools, cloud technologies, and financial markets.
🌱 I’m currently diving into DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and learning more about CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC), and cloud platforms like AWS and Azure.
💻 I have experience with tools like Java, Javascript, Selenium, Cypress, TestNG, ExtentReports, and am well-versed in API automation using frameworks like Karate.
💡 I’m passionate about contributing to open-source projects, especially those related to automation frameworks and DevOps pipelines.
💞️ I’m actively looking to collaborate on DevOps and test automation projects, and I enjoy mentoring junior engineers in automation best practices.
🛠️ In my free time, I work on personal projects that involve automating web applications using Java and Selenium, and I’m exploring performance testing tools.
